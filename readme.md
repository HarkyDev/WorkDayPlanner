## ABOUT THIS PROJECT
This project was designed to show my ability to incoporate the use of a time library like moment.js and also taking its inputs and creating functions that dependant on vars that defined from that library. This can be seen in the function that defines the background colour function that is depends on the time. I also used local storage to save and hold the values that the user inputs, which is a huge part of the user experience.
